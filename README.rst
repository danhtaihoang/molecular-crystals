Effect of dipolar interaction in molecular crystals
=============================================================================================

Abstract
-----------------------------
In this paper we investigate the ground state and the nature of the transition from an
orientational ordered phase at low temperature to the disordered state at high temperature in a
molecular crystal. Our model is a Potts model which takes into account the exchange
interaction J between nearest-neighbor molecules and a dipolar interaction between molecular
axes in three dimensions. The dipolar interaction is characterized by two parameters: its
amplitude D and the cutoff distance rc. If the molecular axis at a lattice site has three
orientations, say the x, y or z axes, then when D = 0, the system is equivalent to the 3-state
Potts model: the transition to the disordered phase is known to be of first order. When D /= 0,
the ground-state configuration is shown to be composed of two independent interpenetrating
layered subsystems which form a sandwich whose periodicity depends on D and rc. We show
by extensive Monte Carlo simulation with a histogram method that the phase transition
remains of first order at relatively large values of rc.
